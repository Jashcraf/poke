    "- `zoom_pos` is the zoom position\n",
    "- `wave_num` is the wavelength\n",
    "- `field_pos` is the FoV to trace\n",
    "- `aper_check` Flag to check apertures. 0 means do not check apertures, non-zero means to check apertures. I don't know what \"check apertures\" means, but I assumes this looks to see if the rays are vignetted\n",
    "- `nrays` is the number of rays in the grid\n",
    "- `^input_array` is a 2xN (where N = nrays) element input array containing the relative pupil coordinates (x,y) for each of the rays to be traced in the grid.\n",
    "- `^output_array` A two-dimensional (i,j) output array. The ith array index can accept values between 1 and 43, corresponding to the output data items in the numbered list below. The jth array index identifies the ray that corresponds to each set of output values, and can accept values between 1 and (N+1), where N is the desired number of grid rays. j=1 corresponds to the chief ray, and the remaining values (2 through (N+1)) correspond to the grid rays specified with the input array. Elements are as follows.\n",
