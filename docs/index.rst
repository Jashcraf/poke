Welcome to poke's documentation!
================================
poke is a polarization ray tracing and gaussian beamlet decomposition module in python. It is meant to link commercial ray tracing engines with open-source diffraction models for comprehensive integrated optical performance modeling.

Summary
------------

**What this software does:**

* Compute Jones Pupils from Zemax OpticStudio sequential optical systems
* Compute OPD experienced by a given ray set 
* Perform diffraction simulation with Gaussian Beamlet Decomposition
